# OptiTrack Packet Encoder/Decoder

This is a library for encoding and decoding OptiTrack packets.

## TODO

- [ ] Update all `Encoder` functions (most are likely broken)
- [ ] `ModelDef` testing
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Change unsigned to signed
- [ ] Move away from use of codecs
- [ ] Wrap value parsing in checked/unchecked trait functions
